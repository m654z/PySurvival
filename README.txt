PySurvival is a game where you find yourself on an island.
You can survive by getting food by farming and hunting, keeping warm and building buildings.
The goal is to survive 100 turns. However, at turn 50 the season changes to winter and your food production is halved and you lose more heat.

Controls
--------

Arrow keys to move.
1 to build a house
2 to build a farm
3 to build a pasture
4 to build a cottage
0 to make clothes
H to hunt
C to chop a forest

Concepts
--------

Hunting - On a Forest tile, press H to hunt. You have a 50% chance of getting 3 food.

Chopping forests - Gain 10 wood. The Forest tile turns into a Grass tile.

Seeds - You have a 33% chance of getting 3 seeds.

Heat - The maximum heat you can have is 40. You lose 1 heat every move, except for when you're on a house or a cottage. During winter you will lose 3 heat every move. Making clothes reduces the amount of heat lost by 1. You can "warm up" in a house or cottage. However, this costs 1 wood in the summer and 2 wood in the winter.

Wool - Used to make clothes. You can make clothes with 10 wool.

Winter - Winter starts at turn 30 and lasts 30 turns. During winter your food production is halved and you lose 3 heat each move. If you survive winter you win the game!
